# new_pc_setup_script
Contains scripts to install custom bash_profile and apps with customisations...so I can wipe and load my machine with no dramas...config mgmt but for my PC :)

## Notes
I intended on usuing shell for this task but I can't run a macos docker, so for the sake of testing im writting a python install script and testing on an Arch linux docker image.
